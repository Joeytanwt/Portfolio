Hey there! I'm Joey – a business analytics student with a passion for turning data into real-world solutions.

I'm always finding creative ways to solve problems, whether it's launching new product lines, optimizing e-commerce platforms, or uncovering insights from complex datasets. I'm adept at working with SQL, Python, and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize data that drives smart decisions.

I worked in the hospitality industry for 10 years and saw many businesses fail, this led me to switch careers to become a business developer. I'm currently leveling up my skills with a Specialist Diploma in Business Analytics and Applied Data Science and a Bachelor's Degree in Global Business Management.

When I'm not knee-deep in data, you'll find me practicing my Spanish/Japanese or brainstorming my next project. Let's connect and explore how we can create something awesome together!
